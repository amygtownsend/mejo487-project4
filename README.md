# Franklin Street Restaurants

Franklin Street in Chapel Hill, NC, is one of the most popular locations for UNC Chapel Hill students and Chapel Hill dwellers to grab a bite to eat. There are currently around 80 food service businesses open, but those who have frequented Franklin St. over the years know that businesses are always coming in and out of the area.

Interested in knowing what the longest standing restaurants and food-serving bars still open on Franklin St. are? I was, so I built a web app using HTML, CSS, JS, Google Maps Javascript API and data from Zomato API and Yellow Pages to find out! The app provides a snapshot of the open food service businesses on Franklin Street in early December 2018, including the year they opened and a cuisine filter.

Curious about how many pizza places we have on Franklin Street? Filter the Google Map by "Pizza" and you'll see that there are eight of them, and four of those have only been open since 2016 or later. Check out the app to discover more!
