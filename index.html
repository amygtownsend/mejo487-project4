    <p>Franklin Street is currently home to 80 food service businesses frequented often by UNC students and residents of
      Chapel Hill and Carrboro. The popular zone consists of restaurants, bars and other businesses on East Franklin
      St., West Franklin St., West Rosemary St. and adjacent streets that border UNC-Chapel Hill's north campus.
      Franklin Street's restaurants and food-serving bars serve a wide range of cuisines and have been enjoyed as far
      back as 1922.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <p>Out of all Franklin Street restaurants that are currently open, the oldest ones are Carolina Coffee Shop and
      Sutton's Drug Store, which opened in 1922 and 1923 respectively. These restaurants are significantly older than
      any others on Franklin Street with a gap of 50 years between Sutton's Drug Store and the next oldest, Ye Olde
      Waffle Shop and McDonald's, both of which opened in 1973.</p>
    <p>All the restaurants that opened between 1923 and 1973 have closed at this point, a reflection of the fast-moving
      nature of Franklin Street's restaurant scene. According to the Downtown Chapel Hill Partnership, the restaurants
      on Franklin Street from January 2013 to January 2018 had a retention rate of 73.8 percent, meaning that over
      one-fourth of restaurants that were open five years ago have now closed.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <p>Franklin Street has 31 restaurants that have only been open since 2015 or later, making up almost 39 percent of
      its restaurants that are currently open. The high amount of newly opened restaurants distinguishes Franklin Street
      as a very popular location for business ventures. Some of the newest foods to join the scene include bubble tea
      and acai bowls, both of which are very popular food trends.</p>
    <p>At least one restaurant serving American cuisine has opened each year since 2013, which is not surprising
      considering the cuisine's popularity. Both coffee and tea shops and pizza places have opened every year since
      2016. The most recent trend in coffee and tea is easily enough linked to the bubble tea craze, but there is no
      similar explanation as to why so many new pizza places have popped up.</p>
    <p>Benny Cappella's joined Franklin Street in 2016 followed by Lotsa Stone Fired Pizza in 2017, and 2018 has brought
      two new pizza spots, the Pizza Press and MidiCi Italian Kitchen. With eight pizza places currently open in total,
      these new restaurants have created a great deal of competition for student business. Unless UNC students and local
      residents begin experiencing an extra-heightened love for pizza, people should expect to see some of these
      restaurants close in the near future.</p>
